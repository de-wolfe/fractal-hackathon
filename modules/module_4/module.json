  "overview": "Module Overview: Visual Linear Algebra\n\nWelcome to Linear Algebra! This module will transform abstract mathematical concepts into vibrant visual experiences. We'll explore the fascinating world of vectors, matrices, and transformations through dynamic visualizations and geometric interpretations.\n\nPicture vectors as arrows in space, matrices as grids that reshape our world, and transformations as mathematical choreography. You'll see how:\n- 2D and 3D coordinate systems come alive with colorful vector movements\n- Matrix operations unfold like geometric puzzles\n- Linear transformations morph shapes before your eyes\n- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal hidden symmetries in nature\n\nWe'll use interactive graphics, color-coded diagrams, and visual animations to make complex concepts crystal clear. By the end, you'll have a rich mental picture library of linear algebra concepts that you can draw upon to solve real-world problems.\n\nPerfect for learners who think in pictures and prefer to \"see\" their mathematics in action!",
